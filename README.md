## Introduction

The War Card Game is a two-player game where players draw cards from a deck and compare their values. The player with the higher value card wins the round, and the game continues until one player has all the cards.

This project was developed as part of an exercise to practice object-oriented programming and basic Java concepts.

## Features

- Models playing card objects with suits and values.
- Fills a hand of 7 cards with random card objects.
- Allows the user to pick a card and searches the hand for a match.
- Provides personal information and prints a congratulatory message if the user guesses correctly.
